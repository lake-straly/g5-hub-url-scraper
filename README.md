This tool is essentially a recreation of the original "URL Collector" created by Sydney Koncz.<br>
~~We created this in preparation for the sunsetting of the @getg5.com email address (which I believe that Chrome extension was whitelisted to).~~<br>
EDIT: The above statement is actually false. The chrome extension still seems to work without being logged into a @getg5.com email address. Regardless, this tool seems to be more robust, and works in the modern G5 Hub.

Just throw the code into a Chrome bookmark (creating a Bookmarklet), and click in when you're on the "home" page of a client in the G5 Hub.<br>
You may have to open the "chrome://bookmarks" page and add it there. There seems to be a character limit if you just right-click the bookmarks bar and attempt to add it there.<br>
