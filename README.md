This tool is essentially a recreation of the original "URL Collector" created by Sydney Koncz.
We created this in preparation for the sunsetting of the @getg5.com email address (which I believe that Chrome extension was whitelisted to).

Just throw the code into a Chrome bookmark (creating a Bookmarklet), and click in when you're on the "home" page of a client in the G5 Hub.
